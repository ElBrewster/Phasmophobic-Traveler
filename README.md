### `Context:`
I spent about a week on this project which was meant to assess my understanding of the learning material for Mod 2 at Turing School.

### `Contributors:`
1. El Brewster
    * [GitHub](https://github.com/ElBrewster)
    * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/el-brewster-9817b0255/)

### `Learning Goals:`
1. Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
2. Work with an API to send and receive data
3. Solidify the code review process using TDD
4. Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### `Technology Used:`
The HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript for this application was written in VS Code and pushed into GitHub. 
I also used NPM packages glide.js and day.js, did TDD through Mocha and Chai, and implemented the fetch API.

## `Resources & Mentions:`
I was thinking about this color scheme article, in particular the iridescent palette in the "Sequential data" section and the second panel in "Sequential schemes":
