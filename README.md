# idea-Box

### `Abstract:`
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser.

### `Installation Instructions:`
<!-- 1. [Click To Open Repo](https://github.com/KarrarQ/idea-Box) -->
2. Click the "Fork" button. (This will create a user copy of the repository.)
3. Open the Terminal application.
4. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to where the local repository will live.
5. In GitHub, click on the green "Code" dropdown.
6. User will see three clone options. Select "SSH".
7. Copy the SSH key.
8. In Terminal, run "git clone [insert copied SSH key here]".
9. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate into the newly created directory.
10. Open the local repository by typing:
    * VS Code - code .

### `Context:`
It took our team a few days (~4) to write the code for this project. We just completed our fourth week of Mod 1 at Turing School.

### `Contributors:`
1. El Brewster

    * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/el-brewster-9817b0255/)

### `Learning Goals:`
1. To use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
2. Work with an API to send and receive data
3. Solidify the code review process
4. Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### `Technology Used:`
The HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript for this application was written in VS Code and pushed into GitHub. 
NPM packages glide.js and day.js, Mocha and Chai, the fetch API.

## `Resources/Mentions:`
I was thinking about this color scheme article, in particular the iridescent palette in the "Sequential data" section and the second panel in "Sequential schemes":
