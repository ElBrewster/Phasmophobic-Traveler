//instantiate AllTrips to get 1traveler's trips with AllTrips method(s)
//or do this in Agent class? idk

//use Alltrips.filterOneClientTrips and set as a property for one traveler, matches userId passed in for AllTrips
//Alltrips will always hand data to user, whether one traveler or an agent; it handles trip data
//Agent handles classes
